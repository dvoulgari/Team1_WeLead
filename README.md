`Introduction`

This project is designed as a Proof of Concept (POC) for a business intelligence service that predicts fuel consumption (miles per gallon, mpg) based on various vehicle attributes. As part of a consulting firm specializing in car rentals, our goal is to develop a predictive model that enables car rental companies to make informed decisions when updating their fleets. The model is built using the Auto MPG dataset.

`Dataset Overview`

Dataset Name: Auto MPG Dataset

Number of Instances: 398

Number of Attributes: 8

Attribute Types: Categorical, Real-valued

Associated Task: Regression

Missing Values: Yes

`Attributes:`

MPG (miles per gallon) - Target variable

Cylinders - Number of cylinders in the engine

Displacement - Engine displacement (cubic inches)

Horsepower - Engine horsepower (may contain missing values)

Weight - Vehicle weight (lbs)

Acceleration - Time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (seconds)

Model Year - Year of the car model (encoded as two-digit values)

Origin - Categorical feature indicating the car's country of origin

`Conclusion`

This Proof of Concept demonstrates a data-driven approach to predicting fuel efficiency using vehicle attributes. The results can help car rental companies optimize their fleet selection based on fuel economy predictions. Future improvements can include integrating additional features, improving model accuracy, and deploying the model as an API for real-time predictions.
